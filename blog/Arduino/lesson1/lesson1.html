			<p>Welcome back and to lesson one. In this lesson we will be setting up everything for Arduinos, and creating our first program that makes a light blink. Let's get started!</p>

			<p>In the last lesson we discussed the basics of Arduinos and a little about materials. Hopefully you will have all materials at this point. </p>
			    	
			<p>Before making anything, you must have the Arduino IDE on a device. The IDE is used to write and upload code to the Arduionos, and will be necessary after the first part of this tutorial. It is free on the official <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino website </a>
			</p>

			<p>Remember in lesson one the multiple pins on the Arduino, which all had different purposes? The 5v pin provides 5 volts of power, and this is enough to power most modules or the led in this project. </p>

			<p>This is a Led, and there are only two things you need to know. First, the long leg is positive, and the right leg is negative. This means that the long leg should be faced towards the power source of the circuit. Second, leds take less voltage (1.8 - 3.3 volts) than the Arduino provides (5 volts). This means that there is too much voltage across the led, and the led may burn out. So, we will need a resistor to reduce the voltage. For some leds, the circuit may work without a resistor, but it is safer and always good practice to have one. If you bought a kit you can try different resistors, but basically any resistor should work (30 - 200 ohms)</p>

	    	<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
	    	<p class="question">What materials should I buy?</p>
	    	<p>For beginners, one of the best tools are the Arduino starter kits that run for 20 - 30 bucks online. These will have everything from breadboards to wires to sensors, and have everything in one package. For these first tutorials, everything will be in there. Additionally, I would recommend getting a led strip such as Neopixels, as there are many cool projects related to them
			</p>
			
			<p class="question">Do I need coding experience?</p>

			<p>Coding knowledge is not required for these early steps, and in fact, Arduino code is a great introduction to coding. You do not need any previous knowledge to learn Arduinos!</p>
