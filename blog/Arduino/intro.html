	<p>Hello and thanks for tuning in! </p>
	    	
	<p>So you want to learn Arduinos. You may have heard about them from a friend or seen them online: these tiny computer boards that have infinite possibilities, pictures of sensors, leds, and countless wires jumbled together, an introduction into the mechanical and electronic side of the world. Arduinos are the most easily accessible and easy to use of the boards, chips, and code that power every electronic in the world.</p>
	
	<p>For me, Arduinos were an alternate way of expressing my creativity through code. It was a fresh take to the world of computer science I knew that was confined within a computer screen, and a way for my same code to have an instant effect in the real world. Nothing makes me happier than seeing LED strips finally light up, experimenting with sensors and modules, and teaching people the wonders of Arduinos.</p>
